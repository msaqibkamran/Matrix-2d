# Matrix-2d
A two-dimensional array (Matrix) class includes and destructor and all necessary deep copy operators.

# About the Project

Create a class Matrix and provide all the necessary methods and operators required for
the proper functioning of the following main. Matrix represents a mathematical matrix:
an mxn two-dimensional array. The class uses an int**mat, and integers m and n as
private members to store the data. The class includes and destructor and all necessary
deep copy operators.
Where the matrices are being read from a file the following format is used: first line
gives the value of m (number of rows), second line is the value of n (number of
columns) and the matrix follows row by row in the next m lines, where each line
contains n values separated by space
